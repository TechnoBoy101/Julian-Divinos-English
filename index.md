<p>I was lying on my bed, thinking, I was having continuous dreams about a man with a cold laughter saying something like rotimeur, remiteor or something like that. I lived with my aunt Janie and my uncle Jack. My aunt was the best person in the world but my uncle was like any other man you would find, drinking, smoking, and spending hours and money at the casino. You must be wondering why I didn’t live my parents right? Well at first I had been told that my parents had died in a gas explosion but one night as I had woken up for a glass of water I heard my aunt and uncle talking……                                                        
</p>
<p>….. “Jack, I see no reason not to tell Julian, he is turning 16, he has to know that his parents aren’t dead.” “No Janie he is still too young. We have already discussed this before.” After that I heard the chairs moving and I knew it was time for me to get back to my room. One question came into my mind. Who were my parents? My aunt had always said that my parents had died when I was just 2 months old so I had never gotten to know my parents.
Next morning at breakfast Aunt Janie was looking strangely nervous. She kept glancing at uncle and then me, uncle- me. After uncle went to office, oh well not to his office, he dosent go to work. He had gone to my boarding school’s office cause I had flooded the bathroom. What! You don’t know the story? Good.</p>
<p>Just kidding.... </p>
